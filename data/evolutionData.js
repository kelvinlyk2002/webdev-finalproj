HK government refused Taiwan's request for single extradiction saying that both Poon and Chan are HK citizens, but proposed an extradiction bill that would allow extradiction not only to Taiwan, but China. Rumours said it was the result of the lobbying of Chinese authorities, targeting HK activist & political refugees from China."

Unmoved, the government retained its voting of the bill on 12 June. CHRF, a joint organization for the pan-democractic fractions in HK, organized a protest which over 1.03 million participated. While the size was large, the protestors voluntarily collected trash left after them and left the street cleaner than before."

At around 16:00, police fired rounds of tear gas on to the crowds near LegCo complex, where there has been a 'notice of no objection' by the police for the assembly there. Hundreds rushed into the Citic Building, causing a stampede. Many injured, but the protestors won a mere 'postponement' for the bill. The police framed the protest as a riot, while causing the chaoes themselves. Many shocked by the act of firing tear gas into first aid stations, an obvious war crime by the HK Police.Police officers from different ranks were photographed throwing bricks to the protestors."

While clashing with the police, the protestors successfully entered the LegCo conference chamber, where they announced the 5 demands - (1) full withdrawal of the bill, (2) retracting the classification of protestors as rioters, (3) amnesty for arrested protestors, (4) an independent inquiry to police brutality & (5) universal suffrage of Chief Executive and LegCo."

                        comment: "More than 230,000 attended the first anti-extradition bill protest in the Kowloon side of Hong Kong on 7 July in Tsim Sha Tsui. This is the largest protest in Hong Kong solely mobilised by netizens and in Kowloon area so far. The protest was aimed at giving a good impression to these visitors, hoping to raise their awareness of the issues and support for their cause. Hard copy booklets about the extradition bill in Simplified Chinese were distributed to mainland tourists, to bypass mainland web censorship. At night, riot police, most of them refusing to exhibit an identification number or warrant card assaulted protestors and journalists alike in Mongkok, raising the hatred towards police by this mob-like behaviour. The protesters presented as evidence five pieces of video footage purportedly showing officers assaulting demonstrators even after they had been pinned down, in a subsequent march on 10 July. However, they were referred to the force's internal investigation unit â€“ the Complaints Against Police Office. "

                        comment: "Since 7 July, protestors switched from the 'default' Causeway Bay -> Admiralty route and started exploring other communities, as they perceived the default route being well-planned by the police. The first to pick up community rotational protests was Sheung Shui, in rememberance of the 2014-2016 protests. A number of dispensaries were vandalised by the protesters because they were thought to be complicit in the mainland Chinese parallel trading. After the riot police resumed traffic by dispersing the crowd, they chased the crowd onto a footbridge leading to Sheung Shui Station, when a handicapped teenager suddenly jumped off the footbridge for escape, luckily was rescued jointly by the journalists. He was eventually arrested, insulted and ushered into the police van."

After the march, protesters moved to the streets near Sha Tin Jockey Club Swimming Pool. Later into the night, as the authorisation according to the Letter of No Objection had expired, protesters moved to the nearby shopping mall, New Town Plaza. At 10 pm, police started using pepper spray on some protesters inside the shopping mall.While protesters were trying to leave via MTR, riot police blocked the entrance of the train station from inside the mall. Meanwhile, another group of riot police followed behind protesters as they proceeded to the station engaging in a tactic called kettling â€“ thereby unnecessarily trapping demonstrators â€“ which sparked reactions from cornered protesters. At the same time, MTR announced that trains would bypass Sha Tin station. Both protesters and bystanders were trapped inside the plaza. Fearing that other protesters would not being able to leave, some individuals stopped the train's doors from closing to ensure that all protesters could evacuate. Police proclaimed that they was asking protestors to leave, but shamefully blocking every accessible transport."

This is also the night, which 'Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times' becomes a popular chanting slogan. After 2 months of protesting, the protestors realised that the government would not respond to them and hence they moved from particular demands to more generic ones - an overhaul of the pro-Beijing administration."

The heightened response from police was due to the deface of Chinese Embassy - Hong Kong Liaison Office in Sai Ying Pun. With the sole purpose of inflicting harm instead of restoring order, police fired unnecessary tear gases into residential areas where no protestors were there and used batons to assault those arrested protestors."

Riot police followed and arrested several alleged protesters in the Wong Tai Sin Station.

At night, riot police arrived to disperse crowds, and they unreasonably attacked a passer-by, causing him to be hospitalized. Other communities springed impromptu assemblies around Hong Kong which police used excessive tear gas in residential areas, including Mei Foo, Wong Tai Sin, Tin Shui Wai, Ma On Shan, and Lam Tin. This tactic was later known as 'blossom everywhere'."

The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was affected by street blockades, major roadways were obstructed and train lines stalled, as thousands of workers across 20 different sectors participated, putting pressure on the government to meet protesters demands. At least seven major rallies and organising assemblies were held throughout areas of Hong Kong. The main rallies took place in Tamar Park in Admiralty, Sha Tin Town Hall, Tuen Mun Park, Discovery Park in Tsuen Wan, Wong Tai Sin Square, MacPherson Playground in Mong Kok and Tin Hau Temple Fung Shui Square in Tai Po. To disperse the protesters, the police force used more than 800 canisters of tear gas, a record number for Hong Kong, in 14 out of 18 districts in Hong Kong. As the police used tear gas in close proximity to many densely populated residential areas, many residents, children, and pets were affected. Many air traffic controllers called in sick, and over 200 flights were cancelled while only one of the airport runways was operational. Following the arrest of a female protester who had her skirt and underwear torn by police officers during the struggle, eleven gender rights advocacy groups, including Gender and Sexual Justice in Action and the Chinese University's Sex and Gender Concern Group called for a rally outside Tin Shui Wai police station to condemn the police over the suspect's mistreatment. Protesters threw eggs at the police while the police used tear gas to disperse the protesters."

Fong stated that he purchased those laser pointers for stargazing, while passers-by supported him . However, police officers choked him and arrested him for 'possession of offensive weapon', while Keith was subsequently hospitalised. On 7 August, a group of teachers and staff members from HKBU held a press conference supporting Fong and condemning police's excessive force. In a police press conference in the afternoon, police representatives stated that the laser pointers he purchased were in fact 'laser guns'. They pathetically attempted to demonstrate the 'laser gun' Fong purchased is able to burn a hole in a paper by pointing it to a black area of a newspaper and holding it steadily for 20 seconds at very short distance. At night, a group of protesters gathered at Hong Kong Space Museum and shined laser pointers on the wall of the museum, some  joked 'Is the building on fire yet?' They hoped to show support to Fong and voice condemnation of his arrest by police, and to show that laser pointers are neither offensive weapons nor effective enough to cause a fire."

Demonstrators marched from Maple Street Playground, set up roadblocks on Yam Chow Street, Cheung Sha Wan Road and besieged the Sham Shui Po Police Station. At 5 pm, the police dispersed protesters using tear gas, though some tear gas canisters landed on a pedestrian footbridge nearby, affecting both journalists and residents. Democracy activists moved on and besieged the police station in Tsim Sha Tsui. The police set up a defence line near the Lane Shopper's Boulevard district and fired bean bag rounds that ruptured the right eye of a female protestor. At 8 pm, protesters moved to Kwai Chung and besieged the Kwai Chung police station. Riot police dispersed the protesters. Demonstrators fled to Kwai Fong station and television footage showed police had fired tear gas and several rounds of rubber bullets from inside the station, create a life-threatening situation for all passer-bys, including trains going through. Another approved gathering was held in Victoria Park at 1 pm, while some protesters occupied major roads and intersections near the Sogo Hong Kong department store in Causeway Bay. Several police disguised as protestors were seen and caught on video tackling and arresting other protesters with the help of the police force at 10 pm. Around ten men dressed as protesters were seen and caught on video passing from under a staircase at a tramstop guarded by the police. This revealed that the police used undercover officers to infiltrate into the demonstration, and performed unlawful acts leading to police's excuse to disperse the crowds. The violent arrest of a young man was filmedâ€”he was pressed by more than one undercover police officer to the concrete road with so much force on his head that he lost at least one front tooth. The protester is not seen to have been resisting arrest and is heard apologising in the video, begging for mercy, and yet the police rubbed his face on the rough concrete road, leaving him with a blood-covered face. The arrest of another protester, during which a police officer was found putting a stick inside his backpack, was filmed. The police force planted evidence to frame the protestor."

While Yuen Long, Tuen Mun, Pat Heung, and Sheung Shui police stations being located closer to downtown Hong Kong and having some detainee capacity, San Uk Ling is more remote, making it difficult for arrested persons to contact outsiders. There are no closed-circuit televisions in the entrance and exit passages, meeting rooms and search rooms of San Uk Ling. In September 2019, 31 people detained in San Uk Ling were sent to North District Hospital, among whom six were seriously injured with bone fractures. One person was beaten to the point that his arm was connected to his torso only through skin. Others had their teeth beaten out, and some suffered intracerebral haemorrhages. There were also deliberate delays in sending the injured to the hospital, and deprivation of necessary medication. Some protesters taken to San Uk Ling also raped and sexually assault by officers there. Six justices of the peace who had wanted to visit San Uk Ling to investigate allegations of mistreatment there saw their request denied."

Thousands of people marched from Tsun Yip Street Playground to the Zero Carbon Building in Kowloon Bay. During the march, protesters expressed concerns about recently installed smart lampposts enabled with facial recognition and video surveillance capabilities. Many worried that the lampposts would be used to further restrict freedom in Hong Kong, as China continues to tighten its grip. During the protest, one of these smart lampposts was knocked down and dismantled. Before the protest began, MTR suddenly announced that stations between the proposed march area, Choi Hung station and Tiu Keng Leng station, would be closed, and claimed the move was necessary to protect MTR facilities and staff safety. Many criticised this decision as an act to restrict freedom of protest, and that by closing these stations, MTR had caused greater disturbance to the public. MTR also arranged special trains for the officers. Protesters criticised MTR for co-operating with the police and called it the 'railway of the Communist Party'."

After a quarrel between some protesters and several middle-aged men inside Prince Edward station, a group of Special Tactical Squad officers rushed into the train cabin and assaulted both protesters and commuters who were inside, beating them with batons and releasing pepper-spray. According to witnesses, police simply stormed the station and beat the people inside without making any arrests, and police were accused of continued and excessive force against passengers who were not resisting. Police also chased and beat citizens inside Yau Ma Tei station. One of the innocent citizen injured and hospitalised for more than 10 needles on his head.

                        comment: "After Carrie Lam invoked the controversial Emergency Regulations Ordinance to impose a law which bans the wearing of face masks in public gatherings, many protesters defied the new law and wore face masks to show their discontent. Protesters occupied Harcourt Road, Nathan Road, Lung Cheung Road and other major thoroughfares. In Yuen Long, an off-duty police officer rammed into the protestors with his car and shot a teenage boy with live ammunition in his left thigh. The boy was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital. After midnight, riot police officers with full gear entered the hospital, obstructing the hospital's operations."

                        comment: "Following a police ban on a protest applied by the CHRF and the attack on CHRF convenor Jimmy Sham, protesters marched from Tsim Sha Tsui to the West Kowloon station to protest against the government's decision to invoke the emergency law and condemn police brutality. After Sham was attacked by a group of suspected South Asians, pro-protest ethnic minorities showed their solidarity with the protesters by distributing cold water to them at the entrance of Chungking Mansions, while some local protesters guarded the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre, demanding passerby not to vandalize the mosque out of retaliation. In contrast, police used blue-dyed water to spray on the mosque."
