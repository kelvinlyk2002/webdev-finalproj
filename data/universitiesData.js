                        comment: "Chow Tsz-lok died on 8 November 2019 after a fall from the third floor in a car park in Tseung Kwan O on 4 November. Chow, a 22-year-old student of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, is believed to be the first to die from injuries sustained during the Hong Kong protests that started in 2019. A round of tear gas was shot at Chow, where he was looking over the confront on the street on the third floor. After his fall, the police obstructed the ambulance."

                        comment: "In escalation of the death of Chow Tsz-lok, protesters disrupted the morning commute on 11 November as part of a plan for a city-wide strike. The protesters continued the strike over the following five days. Protesters began to gather at 6:30 am and then began disrupting both MTR operations and surface transports starting from 7 am. Protesters also made makeshift roadblocks in major thoroughfares in Kowloon and New Territories. In Kwai Chung, a police officer riding a motorcycle charged into a crowd of demonstrators and zig-zagged across the road in a deliberate attempt to hit the protesters."

The man raised his hands once to show that he held no weapons. The traffic policeman pointed a gun at the man's chest and quickly locked him in a choke hold while still holding the gun, pointing it at pedestrians. One unarmed 21-year-old man in black was shot once in the abdomen and fell on the zebra crossing between MTR Exit B and Tai On Building. A third young man, dressed in black, approached and was also shot, once or twice. In total, the traffic policeman fired three live rounds."
