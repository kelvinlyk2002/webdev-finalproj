Despite most being politically apathetic, HK people hoped for a prosperous future while the Western world hoped HK can bring change to the still-socialist China. None happened."

Chinese government responded by flooding tourist to HK and liberalization of HK people doing business in China. Along with the economic takeoff in China, this business community builds up a significant pro-China community in HK."

                        comment: "The first term of government after the handover was appointed by China. The Chief Executive (head of HK government) was elected by a small group appointed by China while only 50% of the Legislative Council (parliament of HK) is democractically elected. As part of the handover deal, China promised there would be universial suffrage to the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council. In 2005, the HK government proposed only a minor change to this method which excluded the universial suffrage. This proposal was eventually denied."

                        comment: "In 2009, HK economy again went into recession. China, while still not closely tied to world economy, suffered relatively minorly. In 1997, Hong Kong's GDP is 18% of China's. In 2009, it has shrinked to 4%. In a bad financial shape, the HK government decided to spend HK$66.9 billion on the construction of HK Express Rail Link, a high speed rail connecting to Guangzhou. Further to the absence of universal suffrage promised in the handover, the popularity of the government starts to deteriorate. The controversy gave birth to the first generation of political aware citizens."

                        comment: "Post 2008 financial tsunami, the United States started Quantitative Easing. HK$ is pegged to US$ and started to depreciate as well. Chinese started to pour into HK in search of higher quality groceries, better medical services while enjoying a great discount of the HK$. While the business sector welcomed the new monies, HKers living in the border communities started to find their neighbourhood being disrupted by the Chinese. HK mothers have difficulties finding hospital to give birth. In 2012, a march called 'Reclaim Sheung Shui Station' was held to push back smugglers in Sheung Shui, a station away from Shenzhen. This is the first sign of turning tide against China in Hong Kong. According to the poll done by the University of Hong Kong, people's net satisfactoon of the government dropped from +36% to -36% over the course of 2008-2011."

Prof. Tai Yiu-ting, Prof. Chan Kin-man & Rev. Chu Yiu-ming proposed a civil disobedience campaign advocating for an universal suffrage in the 2017 Chief Executive election. The organizers built their campaign's legitimacy by dialogs, deliberations, and finally a civil referendum over the course of a year, planning to start from 1 Oct 2014, the national day of China. Tai, a law professor, emphasized love and peace, non-violence, and even a willing surrender to the police, as part of the civil disobedience doctrine. In Aug 31, 2014, China has decided not to allow universal suffrage in the 2016 Legco election and the 2017 Chief Executive election. "

                        comment: "Scholarism, led by Joshua Wong, and HK Federation of Students, led by Alex Chow, started a class boycott in September 22, 2014 in response to the 831 decision by China. The students gathered at the CUHK campus wearing white shirts and yellow ribbons. Subsequently, the boycott moved to Tamar Park, an open area next to the Central Government Complex, Admiralty, a stone's throw away from Central. At the night of 26th, Joshua Wong suddenly called to reclaim Civic Plaza, a planned open space but fenced by the government, in the middle of his speech. He led a group of the crowd into the plaza while police started to clash with the participants. After a night of clashes where riot police used pepper spray and protestors used umbrella to protect themselves. Eventually, police surrounded the Civic Plaza but being counter-surrounded by enraged citizens, watched the clashes from news. While the leaders being arrested, the crowd continued to stay near Admiralty during September 27. On September 28, Monday, 1:30AM, Prof. Tai announced the start of Occupy Central, which is now signified by the umbrella, which protected the citizens from pepper spray and the yellow ribbons, which the student wore."

                        comment: "HKers used to political apathetic. What moved them are the horrible scenes of police's 87 rounds of tear gases against the peaceful protestors in the dusk of September 28. In shock, thousands of citizens gathered at Admiralty to defend the students from the police. People started to spillover to the streets and occupied Admiralty. While police retreated, the government deployed dirty tactics in order to discourage the occupants. They paid pro-Beijing proxies and triads to cause chaos in the occupied areas, while applying injunctions to disperse the crowds, granted by the court in December, 2014. Eventually, the government ignored the occupation and let the occupants divided themselves on future direction. The occupation ended after 79 days in December, 2014, while Occupants learned that their government would never listen to them, by being non-violent and rational, because Hong Kong does not have a complete sovereignty. Also, they have learned that distancing from each other won't help - as broad as the political spectrum are, they must unite to fight a common foe."

Finer division of localism ranged from moderate to radical emerged in to the scene of HK politics, as the people of HK is no longer satisfied with the traditional democratic parties. Youngspiration, a more moderate organization, subsequently won a seat on District Council and 2 seats on Legistlative Council. HK Indigenous, a more radical organization, co-organized numerous 'Liberate' (光復) movements against the Chinese tourists in their hotspots, Tuen Mun, Sheung Shui, Yuen Long & Shatin."

However, as they are unable to use the policing doctrines from a civil society (as any civil government would have collapsed/conceded shall a movement as large as Umbrella Movement occurs), they turned to violent and dirty tactics instead. 7 Police ranked from front line officer to Chief Inspector shamelessly handcuffed and then beaten Ken Tsang Kin-chiu for over 4 minutes. As the lawsuit would only convict these officers 6 years later, the culture of brutality takes root in the Police Force which bred the widespread brutality in 2019."

As the Umbrella Movement ultimately failed, in terms of its goal to fight for universial suffrage, some lost hope in 'traditional' opposition but rathering fighting in the streets and clashing with the police. This prompted severe infighting between the pan-democractic fractions, and led the democractic movements to a low point where advocates fight against each other."

However, in 2016, the government decided to swipe the night market in Mongkok. HK Indigenous decided to protect the hawkers and clashed with the government enforcers. Police was called to the scene, and out of a sudden, an officer pointed his gun to the people and fire 2 warning shots to the sky. This has only further enraged the crowds and after rounds of escalation, by the early morning, the conflict has escalated to an all-out clash. The police used excuses to try to disperse those who visit the night markets, while exercising unneccesary forces. This is the first scene of 'valiant' on large scale in HK."
