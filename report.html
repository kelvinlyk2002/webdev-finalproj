          <h1 class="font-weight-light">Large Coursework - Kelvin Yui Kwan Law</h1>
          <p class="lead">Student ID: 190318033</p>
          <h3 class="font-weight-light">Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type
            of structure did you choose to implement.</h3>
          <p class="lead">As a resident in Hong Kong it is hard to distant myself in what have happened since June 2019,
            which some would call "Summer of Freedom". It is the largest democratic movement Hong Kong has ever seen,
            and likely it is history in the making. It is hoped for this website to provide a brief and concise overview
            of the movement, from a local's point of view.</p>
          <h3 class="font-weight-light">State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Infographics and interviews from Vox</strong> - like <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_RdnVtfZPY">this</a>. It described the movement really well,
              informative and concise. I would hope my website to be able to do a similar job, telling the visitors
              stories that are not too long to lose their attention, while long enough to cover the main points.</li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Acts of unsung heros in the movement</strong> - there are many small gestures from
              the protestors and the bystanders that are not reported in the news, but it showed the bonding of the
              people in HK where one would help each other. Such as in the attacks of CUHK, where kilometers of
              motorists used their cars to block the rear road of the university, protecting the students from
              unexpected attacks. </li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Versatility of modern web development langugages</strong> - They are so versatile
              that a simple &lt;video&gt; allows playing a video, the seemingly unending Functionalities of JS and its
              libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap making responsive very easy.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="font-weight-light">State 3 ways in which your site is accessible</h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Alt texts</strong> - Alternative texts were included for the images presented in
              the content pages.</li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Semantic tags</strong> - In most cases, the correct semantic tags such as h1, h3,
              p, nav were used, while avoiding non-semantic tags such as span. It provided users with a nice sense of
              structure regarding the content.</li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>ARIA tags</strong> - Adopted from the template, the ARIA tags for the carosel
              slider are useful to maintain the accessibility.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="font-weight-light">State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Responsive design</strong> - The website has responsive design such as collapsible
              nav bar and responsive layouts. Also, the design is sensible and it is laid out as a web user would
              expect. The architecture is also consistent. Enough whitespaces are allocated using margins and paddings
              to ensure the content are easy to read.</li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Balance of content</strong> - In the content, videos are compressed and converted
              to GIFs in order to perform better and improve adaptability across browsers. </li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Validated codes</strong> - The codes are <a
                href="https://validator.w3.org">validated</a> to ensure the contents can be rendered correctly.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="font-weight-light">State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site,
            and describe how you did that.</h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>$.getJSON()</strong> - In drafting the structure of the content pages, I wished to
              separate the data from the html as suggested in the lectures. However, I found out that it is not possible
              to read local JSON files without making amendments to security settings. Firstly I looked to jQuery as it
              is a powerful and common framework that would likely have the needed features. I found the method
              $.getJSON() [!], which when I applied the console logged that it cannot be done due to security measures.
              There are also native support by using the Fetch API [!] and I have also read that some technology stack
              that can achieve reading/writing local JSON files, such as MongoDB + NodeJS. However, in this project, it
              would be an overkill and I have worked around by wrapping the data in a variable instead.</li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>{{each }}</strong> - I first learned about handlebars in the lectures, and I was
              eager to apply it. Previously I had experience developing in PHP but very few chances on working with
              client-side compiling. The lecture used a custom helper in order to demostrate the helpers functions in
              handlebars but a {{each }} built-in helper is available to create a similar for loop effect. [!] Thus I
              used the built in helper instead and the result (json+handlebars) is much cleaner than a SQL+php+jQuery
              implementation.</li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>git commit -a -m "progress"</strong> - I have also used git to maintain version
              control and keep progress of the website. It is accessible on my github: <a
                href="https://github.com/kelvinlyk2002/webdev-finalproj">here</a>. Although I have some development
              experience before, I seldom use git since I was working by myself. I have decided to use git for this
              project even if it is individual, so I can have more experience. It was a valuable learning experience
              since git is a popular version control & almost an industry standard.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="font-weight-light">What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
          <p class="lead">In this project, I think there are 2 aspects of work that I think worked well.</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Implementation of templates</strong> - I have made use of bootstrap templates
              available online and adjusting them to be applicable to this website. In doing so, I have learned a lot
              about the framework such as the grid system, the use of class in picking the right CSS, and successfully
              created a beautiful webpage. Also, I am made aware of the copyright and license as instructed. Thus, I was
              mindful when searching for templates to begin my work, also to take record of how I editted them and
              fitted them to my use. </li>
            <li class="pb-3"><strong>Use of handlebars</strong> - Since the content pages (Origin, Evolution, Darkest
              Hours, Beyond HK) are having the same structure, the use of handlebars as introduced is very useful. It
              was implemented for the repetitive part in the middle of the page, allowing the separation of data and
              template, following the MVC pattern where the data can be maintained easily.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 class="font-weight-light">What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things
            differently another time?</h3>
          <p class="lead">Student ID: 190318033</p>

          <h3 class="font-weight-light">What resources were used when creating your work? </h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="pb-3">
              <strong>HTML & CSS</strong> - This website used heavily on the bootstrap framework and also referred much
              of the CSS codes from MIT-licensed templates and snippets. They are built very aesthetically and much more
              efficient than I would be building from scratch. It also jumpstarted the progress as the previews are
              available, as cited in the reference section.
            </li>
            <li class="pb-3">
              <strong>Photos & Videos</strong> - Photos and videos are collected from local and international news
              media, as well as online discussion boards and groups. Other image collection websites such as <a
                href="https://www.pinterest.com/wildwong/hong-kong-antielab/">pinterest.com</a> are also used to search
              for relevant images.
            </li>
            <li class="pb-3">
              <strong>Functionalities</strong> - When I was implementing the templates and the handlebars, I have made
              multiple references to <a href="stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> to seek guidance, example, or
              inspiration on an implementation I need. Most of the time the solutions I found are very close to the one
              I need, but I would need to adjust and make them applicable to my needs.
