            <ol>
                <li>In drafting the structure of the content pages, I wished to separate the data from the html as suggested in the lectures. However, I found out that it is not possible to read local JSON files without making amendments to security settings. Firstly I looked to jQuery as it is a powerful and common framework that would likely have the needed features. I found the method $.getJSON() [!], which when I applied the console logged that it cannot be done due to security measures. There are also native support by using the Fetch API [!] and I have also read that some technology stack that can achieve reading/writing local JSON files, such as MongoDB + NodeJS. However, in this project, it would be an overkill and I have worked around by wrapping the data in a variable instead.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>I first learned about handlebars in the lectures, and I was eager to apply it. Previously I had experience developing in PHP but very few chances on working with client-side compiling. The lecture used a custom helper in order to demostrate the helpers functions in handlebars but a {{each }} built-in helper is available to create a similar for loop effect. [!] Thus I used the built in helper instead and the result (json+handlebars) is much cleaner than a SQL+php+jQuery implementation.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>I have also used git to maintain version control and keep progress of the website. It is accessible on my github: <a href="https://github.com/kelvinlyk2002/webdev-finalproj">here</a>. Although I have some development experience before, I seldom use git since I was working by myself. I have decided to use git for this project even if it is individual, so I can have more experience. It was a valuable learning experience since git is a popular version control & almost an industry standard.</li>
