            <h3 class="font-weight-light">Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.</h3>
            <p class="lead">As a resident in Hong Kong it is hard to distant myself in what have happened since June 2019, which some would call "Summer of Freedom". It is the largest democratic movement Hong Kong has ever seen, and likely it is history in the making. It is hoped for this website to provide a brief and concise overview of the movement, from a local's point of view.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3 class="font-weight-light">State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="pb-3"><strong>$.getJSON()</strong> - In drafting the structure of the content pages, I wished to separate the data from the html as suggested in the lectures. However, I found out that it is not possible to read local JSON files without making amendments to security settings. Firstly I looked to jQuery as it is a powerful and common framework that would likely have the needed features. I found the method $.getJSON() [!], which when I applied the console logged that it cannot be done due to security measures. There are also native support by using the Fetch API [!] and I have also read that some technology stack that can achieve reading/writing local JSON files, such as MongoDB + NodeJS. However, in this project, it would be an overkill and I have worked around by wrapping the data in a variable instead.</li>
                <li class="pb-3"><strong>{{each }}</strong> - I first learned about handlebars in the lectures, and I was eager to apply it. Previously I had experience developing in PHP but very few chances on working with client-side compiling. The lecture used a custom helper in order to demostrate the helpers functions in handlebars but a {{each }} built-in helper is available to create a similar for loop effect. [!] Thus I used the built in helper instead and the result (json+handlebars) is much cleaner than a SQL+php+jQuery implementation.</li>
                <li class="pb-3"><strong>git commit -a -m "progress"</strong> - I have also used git to maintain version control and keep progress of the website. It is accessible on my github: <a href="https://github.com/kelvinlyk2002/webdev-finalproj">here</a>. Although I have some development experience before, I seldom use git since I was working by myself. I have decided to use git for this project even if it is individual, so I can have more experience. It was a valuable learning experience since git is a popular version control & almost an industry standard.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="font-weight-light">What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
            <p class="lead">In this project, I think there are 2 aspects of work that I think worked well.
                <ol>
                    <li class="pb-3"><strong>Implementation of templates</strong> - I have made use of bootstrap templates available online and adjusting them to be applicable to this website. In doing so, I have learned a lot about the framework such as the grid system, the use of class in picking the right CSS, and successfully created a beautiful webpage. Also, I am made aware of the copyright and license as instructed. Thus, I was mindful when searching for templates to begin my work, also to take record of how I editted them and fitted them to my use. </li>
                    <li class="pb-3"><strong>Use of handlebars</strong> - Since the content pages (Origin, Evolution, Darkest Hours, Beyond HK) are having the same structure, the use of handlebars as introduced is very useful. It was implemented for the repetitive part in the middle of the page, allowing the separation of data and template, following the MVC pattern where the data can be maintained easily.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-light">What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h3>
            <p class="lead">Student ID: 190318033</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-light">What resources were used when creating your work? </h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="pb-3">
                    <strong>HTML & CSS</strong> - This website used heavily on the bootstrap framework and also referred much of the CSS codes from MIT-licensed templates and snippets. They are built very aesthetically and much more efficient than I would be building from scratch. It also jumpstarted the progress as the previews are available, as cited in the reference section.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                    <strong>Photos & Videos</strong> - Photos and videos are collected from local and international news media, as well as online discussion boards and groups. Other image collection websites such as <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/wildwong/hong-kong-antielab/">pinterest.com</a> are also used to search for relevant images.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                    <strong>Functionalities</strong> - When I was implementing the templates and the handlebars, I have made multiple references to <a href="stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> to seek guidance, example, or inspiration on an implementation I need. Most of the time the solutions I found are very close to the one I need, but I would need to adjust and make them applicable to my needs.
